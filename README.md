# Nemo Ocean Angle
## Fishackthon 2016

### Proposal
Gear location should be visible on an app compatible with both android and iphones The app or
program would need to update the gearâ€™s location in real time since fishers often move the same trap
to a different location to follow lobster migration throughout the fishing season.

### Scenario
We design a system that can monitor gear location and real-time tracking on map. If some trouble happened, for instance, the buoy is lose, our device would emit a backup one.

### Challenges
+ Underwater communication problem
+ Shared data v.s. private data
+ Fishing gear tracking

### How Nemo Ocean Angle Helps
+ Stragightly and quickly recycle fishing gear.
+ Avoid collision between boat and fishing gear and help track ghost fishing, for example, the Bay of Fundy.

Note that you need to create database in mysql.

> CREATE TABLE INFO \(
> num INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
> id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
> type INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
> text VARCHAR\(255\),
> picture BLOB,
> ext VARCHAR\(10\),
> update_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
> \);
>
> CREATE TABLE MAP \(
> id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
> latitude DOUBLE NOT NULL,
> longitude DOUBLE NOT NULL,
> uid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
> private INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
> \);
>
> CREATE TABLE USER \(
> num INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
> name VARCHAR\(255\) NOT NULL,
